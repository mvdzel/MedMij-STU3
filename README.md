## Nictiz-STU3

This repository contains HL7 FHIR STU3 compliant profiles. The FHIR profiles in this repository are based on the Dutch Clinical Building Blocks / Healthcare Information models (Dutch: [Zorginformatiebouwsteen or ZIB](https://zibs.nl/wiki/Zorginformatiebouwstenen "Zorginformatiebouwstenen")). 

At the moment, these FHIR profiles cover only the ZIBs that are part of the [Basisgegevensset Zorg](https://www.registratieaandebron.nl/wat-is-registreren-aan-de-bron/de-kern-van-registreren-aan-de-bron/basisgegevensset/ "Basisgegevensset Zorg") (BGZ).

The Dutch National ICT institute in the Netherlands (Nictiz) maintains this repository and its contents. A number core profiles contained have been developed under HL7 Netherlands responsability in cooperation with Nictiz and other parties. These profiles are marked slightly different in the name (nl-core-\*), the url (http://fhir.nl/*) and their publisher (HL7 Netherlands). Profiles by HL7 Netherlands are Patient, Organization, Practitioner, RelatedPerson, HealthcareService, EpisodeOfCare, Location, and datatypes Address and HumanName.
